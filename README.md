## Welcome

Thanks for looking into the project. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

So all usual npm tasks works here as well. Below 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` (sorry no tests within the given time limit)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is as shown below

```

## Thanks for watching!
